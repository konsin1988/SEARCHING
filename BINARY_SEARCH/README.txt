/* An array of n int elements is created.
/* The array consists of random elements from span (START; END).
/* Allocate memory for N elements by function malloc.
/* Array is sorted by merge sort function.
/* After sorting, the program performs a binary search 
/* for an element in the array and prints its index 
/* (NULL if there is none).
/* It is possible to print or not to print (y/n option) 
/* initial and sorted arrays.

/* Search for a subarray with the maximum sum of elements. 
/* The array is filled with the rand function. 
/* The number of elements is set by the user. 
/* Programm prints the array itself (optional), 
/* the first and last indices of the maximum 
/* (by the sum of elements) subsequence, 
/* as well as the sum of the elements itself. 
/* The program makes sense only if there are negative 
/* elements in the array. Otherwise, the result 
/* will be the entire array (as the maximum sum of elements).
